# Tree & Graph

So my main.py file is for manipulate a tree 

the graph.py is the one tyo manipulate a graph.
I dont know if I have done like I should have, however, not like for the tree, I have two kind of node
- the Main/master one : that store the first level of 
- others node : the basic node, that are manipulated and organised

main Node
    List -> node(s)
                first ->list node(s)
                    first ->list node(s)
                    second ->list node(s)
                    third ->list node(s)
                second ->list node(s)
                    first ->list node(s)
                third ->list node(s)
                    first ->list node(s)
                    second ->list node(s)
